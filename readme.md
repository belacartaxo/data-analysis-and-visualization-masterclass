# 2025 Python Data Analysis & Visualization Masterclass
This repository contains the code I developed as part of the **2025 Python Data Analysis & Visualization Masterclass course**. The course helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis and visualization, using tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. During the course, I had the opportunity to work with real-world datasets and learn how to analyze and visualize data effectively.

## What I Learned:
- Mastering Pandas DataFrames and Series for data manipulation
- Creating stunning visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Organizing, filtering, cleaning, aggregating, and analyzing data
- Working with hierarchical indexing in Pandas
- Merging and combining datasets efficiently
- Extracting and manipulating time, date, and textual data
- Creating various types of plots, including line, bar, scatter, pie, violin, box, and more
- Key Topics Covered:
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development
- Analyzing real-world datasets such as Amazon bestsellers, stock prices, presidential tweets, UFO sightings, and more
- Data cleaning and pre-processing using Pandas
- Data visualization fundamentals and advanced techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn

This course provided a comprehensive and practical approach to data analysis and visualization, with hands-on exercises that helped solidify my understanding of key concepts. I'm excited to continue applying these new skills in my future data-related projects.

Feel free to explore the code and datasets used in the course. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out!
