    "### Converting Strings to Datetime\n",
    "Pandas provides the `pd.to_datetime()` function to convert strings to datetime objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(\"2019-12-31\")\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(\"2019/12/31\")\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(\"December 31st 2019\")\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(\"December 31st 2019 4pm\")\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(\"December 31st 2019 4:50am\")\n",

    "pd.to_datetime(\"3:55:45 Apr. 2nd 90\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Ambiguous Formats\n",
    "You can specify whether the day or year appears first when handling ambiguous date formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(\"10/11/12\", dayfirst=True)  # Interprets as 10th November 2012\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(\"10/11/12\", yearfirst=True, dayfirst=True)  # Interprets as 2010 11th December\n",

    "Use the format parameter to define a specific date format.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting a Series\n",
    "`pd.to_datetime()` also works with Pandas Series.\n",

    "```Python\n",
    "dates = pd.Series([\"2022-03-15\", \"March 20th 2023\", \"15/03/2022\"])\n",
    "pd.to_datetime(dates)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parsing Dates During CSV Reading\n",
    "You can specify which columns to parse as dates when reading a CSV file.\n",

    "df = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\", parse_dates=[\"date_column\"])\n",

    "## Comparing Dates in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with date and time data in Pandas, you can easily perform comparisons to filter or analyze your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Entire Dates\n",
    "You can compare dates directly using string representations. Pandas will automatically parse the strings into datetime objects for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare with only the year:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  ufos[\"date_time\"] > \"1980\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare with a full date (year, month, and day):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ufos[\"date_time\"] > \"2019-12-10\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠ Note**: If you include equality (== or >=), remember that the comparison might fail due to time components (e.g., hour, minute, second). Ensure the time is accounted for if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Specific DateTime Attributes\n",
    "You can compare specific components of a datetime object using the .dt accessor:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the hour:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ufos[\"date_time\"].dt.hour == 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using between\n",
    "To check if dates fall within a range, you can use the .between() method. This is useful for inclusive comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ufos[\"date_time\"].between(\"2017\", \"2020\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will include all dates from 2017-01-01 to 2020-12-31.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Pandas handles string-to-datetime conversion automatically in comparisons.\n",
    "- When comparing only years or specific attributes, use the .dt accessor.\n",
    "- Use between() for an easy and readable way to filter a range of dates."
